echo "=================================================="

echo ""
echo "1. Testing CLI mode (should show wallets immediately):"
echo "BLOCO_TUI=false ./bloco-eth --prefix A --count 1 --progress --threads 4"
echo ""

echo "2. Testing TUI mode (should show TUI during generation, then show wallets after):"
echo "When run in an interactive terminal:"
echo "./bloco-eth --prefix A --count 1 --progress --threads 4"
echo ""

echo "Expected behavior:"
echo "- CLI mode: Shows wallets as they are generated (inline display)"
echo "- TUI mode: Shows progress in TUI, then displays all wallets clearly after TUI exits"
echo ""

echo "The key improvement:"
echo "- Before: TUI mode would not show the generated wallets anywhere"  
echo "- After: TUI mode shows wallets in a clear, formatted way after the TUI completes"
echo ""

echo "This ensures that users can always see their generated wallets regardless of the display mode used."
