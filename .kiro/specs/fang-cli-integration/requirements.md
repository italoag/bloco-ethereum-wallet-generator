# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates Charmbracelet Fang with the existing Cobra CLI implementation to provide an enhanced, interactive command-line interface for the bloco wallet generator. Fang will work alongside Cobra to offer a more user-friendly and visually appealing CLI experience while maintaining all existing functionality and performance characteristics.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want an enhanced interactive CLI experience that maintains all existing Cobra functionality, so that I can generate bloco wallets with improved usability and visual feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing Cobra commands (root, benchmark, stats)
2. WHEN Fang is integrated THEN the system SHALL preserve all current command-line flags and options
3. WHEN users run commands THEN the system SHALL provide enhanced visual feedback through Fang's styling capabilities
4. IF a user runs the application THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing CLI usage patterns

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want improved visual presentation of command output and progress information, so that I can better understand the wallet generation process and results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying wallet generation results THEN the system SHALL use Fang's styling for enhanced readability
2. WHEN showing progress information THEN the system SHALL leverage Fang's visual components for better user experience
3. WHEN displaying error messages THEN the system SHALL use consistent styling and formatting
4. WHEN showing statistics and benchmark results THEN the system SHALL present information with improved visual hierarchy

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want interactive prompts and confirmations for potentially long-running operations, so that I can make informed decisions about resource-intensive wallet generation tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pattern has high difficulty (>1000000) THEN the system SHALL prompt the user for confirmation before proceeding
2. WHEN running benchmark operations THEN the system SHALL provide interactive options for configuration
3. WHEN generating multiple wallets THEN the system SHALL offer interactive progress monitoring options
4. IF the user cancels an operation THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the interruption

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Fang integration to be modular and maintainable, so that the codebase remains clean and the integration doesn't interfere with existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating Fang THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing single-file architecture pattern
2. WHEN adding Fang components THEN the system SHALL organize code logically within the existing structure
3. WHEN implementing interactive features THEN the system SHALL use proper error handling and graceful degradation
4. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL include Fang dependencies in the build process without breaking existing builds
