# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds Charmbracelet Bubbletea TUI (Terminal User Interface) support to the bloco-eth application to enhance the user experience with interactive, styled interfaces for benchmarks, statistics, progress tracking, and data presentation. The integration will replace the current text-based output with modern TUI components while maintaining all existing functionality and CLI compatibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user running benchmarks, I want an interactive TUI interface with styled tables and progress indicators, so that I can better visualize benchmark results and performance metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs `./bloco-eth benchmark` THEN the system SHALL display an interactive TUI with animated progress bars using Bubbletea components
2. WHEN benchmark results are available THEN the system SHALL display results in a formatted table using Bubbletea table components
3. WHEN the benchmark is running THEN the system SHALL show real-time performance metrics with styled text and progress indicators
4. WHEN the user presses Ctrl+C during benchmark THEN the system SHALL gracefully exit the TUI and return to terminal
5. IF the benchmark completes THEN the system SHALL display final results in a comprehensive table format with proper styling

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user viewing statistics, I want a styled TUI interface that presents statistical data in organized tables, so that I can easily understand difficulty calculations and probability metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs `./bloco-eth stats` THEN the system SHALL display statistics in a formatted table using Bubbletea table components
2. WHEN displaying difficulty metrics THEN the system SHALL use styled text with appropriate colors and formatting
3. WHEN showing probability calculations THEN the system SHALL present data in organized rows and columns with clear headers
4. IF the statistics are complex THEN the system SHALL use proper table formatting with borders and alignment
5. WHEN the user views the statistics THEN the system SHALL maintain the same data accuracy as the current text-based output

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user generating wallets with progress tracking, I want an animated progress bar with real-time statistics, so that I can monitor generation progress with better visual feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs wallet generation with `--progress` flag THEN the system SHALL display an animated progress bar using Bubbletea progress components
2. WHEN the generation is running THEN the system SHALL show real-time statistics including attempts, speed, and ETA with styled formatting
3. WHEN progress updates occur THEN the system SHALL smoothly animate the progress bar transitions
4. IF the generation takes a long time THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive UI updates without blocking
5. WHEN the wallet is found THEN the system SHALL display success message with styled formatting and final statistics

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the CLI, I want enhanced help text and command descriptions with consistent styling, so that the interface follows modern TUI design patterns similar to Fang.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs `./bloco-eth --help` THEN the system SHALL display help text with consistent styling and formatting
2. WHEN viewing command descriptions THEN the system SHALL use styled text with appropriate colors and emphasis
3. WHEN displaying examples THEN the system SHALL format code examples with proper highlighting and indentation
4. IF the user views subcommand help THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent styling across all help interfaces
5. WHEN the CLI starts THEN the system SHALL follow the same design patterns and styling as the Fang CLI framework

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the application, I want the TUI integration to be modular and maintainable, so that existing functionality remains intact while new TUI features can be easily extended.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TUI components are added THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing CLI functionality
2. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL automatically detect terminal capabilities and fall back to text mode if needed
3. WHEN new TUI features are added THEN the system SHALL follow a consistent architecture pattern for easy maintenance
4. IF TUI components fail THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to text-based output without losing functionality
5. WHEN the code is structured THEN the system SHALL separate TUI logic from core business logic for better maintainability

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user working in different terminal environments, I want the TUI to adapt to various terminal sizes and capabilities, so that the interface works consistently across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the terminal is resized THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust TUI components to fit the new dimensions
2. WHEN running in a small terminal THEN the system SHALL adapt table layouts and progress bars to available space
3. WHEN the terminal doesn't support colors THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to monochrome display
4. IF the terminal has limited capabilities THEN the system SHALL disable advanced TUI features and use simpler alternatives
5. WHEN the TUI is displayed THEN the system SHALL respect terminal color schemes and accessibility settings
