# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature completes the final cleanup and stabilization of the TUI (Terminal User Interface) integration in the bloco-eth application. The focus is on resolving remaining test failures, cleaning up duplicate TUI directories, and ensuring all components work together seamlessly while maintaining 100% backward compatibility with existing CLI functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer running tests, I want all test suites to pass without failures, so that the application is stable and ready for production use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `go test ./...` THEN the system SHALL pass all tests without any build failures or test failures
2. WHEN running `make test` THEN the system SHALL complete successfully with exit code 0
3. WHEN running tests for TUI components THEN the system SHALL not have undefined references or missing dependencies
4. IF there are duplicate test files THEN the system SHALL consolidate them to avoid conflicts
5. WHEN all tests pass THEN the system SHALL maintain the same test coverage as before the TUI integration

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want a clean directory structure without duplicate TUI implementations, so that the code is maintainable and follows a single source of truth pattern.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the project structure THEN the system SHALL have only one TUI directory (`internal/tui/`)
2. WHEN there are duplicate TUI files THEN the system SHALL consolidate them into the primary TUI location
3. WHEN consolidating files THEN the system SHALL preserve all working functionality from both implementations
4. IF there are conflicting implementations THEN the system SHALL choose the most complete and stable version
5. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL have no orphaned or unused TUI files

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user of the application, I want the TUI integration to work seamlessly with all existing CLI commands, so that I can use both text and visual interfaces without any functionality loss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `./bloco-eth --prefix a --progress` THEN the system SHALL display either TUI or CLI progress based on terminal capabilities
2. WHEN running `./bloco-eth benchmark --attempts 1000` THEN the system SHALL show benchmark results in the appropriate interface
3. WHEN using `BLOCO_TUI=true` environment variable THEN the system SHALL force TUI mode when possible
4. IF TUI is not available THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to CLI mode without errors
5. WHEN all commands are tested THEN the system SHALL maintain identical functionality between TUI and CLI modes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the Fang CLI framework, I want the TUI components to work harmoniously with Fang's signal handling and command execution, so that the user experience is consistent and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Fang's signal handling THEN the system SHALL properly integrate TUI cleanup with Fang's shutdown process
2. WHEN Fang executes commands THEN the system SHALL seamlessly transition between CLI and TUI modes
3. WHEN handling interrupts THEN the system SHALL coordinate between Fang and TUI signal handlers
4. IF there are signal handling conflicts THEN the system SHALL prioritize graceful shutdown over feature completeness
5. WHEN the integration is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a unified user experience across all interfaces

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging for TUI operations, so that issues can be diagnosed and resolved quickly in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TUI initialization fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure reason and fall back to CLI mode
2. WHEN terminal capabilities are insufficient THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about the fallback
3. WHEN TUI components encounter errors THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without crashing
4. IF debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logs about TUI decision-making
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL maintain application functionality while providing useful error information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user working with the completed application, I want all documentation and help text to reflect the new TUI capabilities, so that I can understand and utilize all available features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `./bloco-eth --help` THEN the system SHALL display information about TUI capabilities and environment variables
2. WHEN viewing command help THEN the system SHALL include examples of both CLI and TUI usage
3. WHEN reading documentation THEN the system SHALL explain how to enable/disable TUI mode
4. IF TUI features are available THEN the system SHALL highlight them in help text and examples
5. WHEN the documentation is complete THEN the system SHALL provide troubleshooting information for TUI issues
