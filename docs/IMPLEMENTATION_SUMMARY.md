   - Auto-detection of available CPU cores
   - Configurable thread count via CLI flag
   - Work distribution across workers
   - Graceful shutdown mechanism

2. **Worker**: Individual worker threads with optimized resources
   - Worker-local object pools for better performance
   - Optimized cryptographic operations
   - Local statistics collection
   - Batch processing for efficiency

3. **StatsManager**: Thread-safe statistics aggregation
   - Real-time performance metrics
   - Thread utilization statistics
   - Efficiency ratio calculation
   - Peak performance tracking

4. **Object Pooling**: Memory optimization through object reuse
   - CryptoPool for cryptographic structures
   - HasherPool for Keccak256 hashers
   - BufferPool for byte and string buffers
   - Secure cleanup of sensitive data

5. **CLI Integration**: User-friendly interface
   - `--threads` flag for manual control
   - Auto-detection when threads=0
   - Validation and error handling
   - Backward compatibility

## Performance Improvements

- **Linear Scaling**: Performance scales nearly linearly with the number of CPU cores
